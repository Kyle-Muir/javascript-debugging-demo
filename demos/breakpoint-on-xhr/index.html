	<h1>Breakpoints on XHR | <a href="..\index.html">Back</a></h1>
	<p>
		Breakpoints on XHR is a useful way of simply making Chrome stop when a web request is made to a web api or similar.
	</p>
	<p>
		XHR breakpoints are conditional by default which is extremely useful if you have a large application and don't want to step through controller -> service -> whatever -> XHR request. You can simply say "break when the URL contains 'blah'".
	</p>
	<p>
		You can make XHR breakpoints catch all XHR requests by specifying no url to match on.
	</p>
	<p>
		Breakpoint by XHR does have some gotchas - for example, with jQuery it lands you in the jQuery function that makes XHR requests rather than your custom logic. Unfortunately, not even <a href="../blackbox-scripts/index.html">blackboxing</a> scripts like jQuery affects this behaviour. However, that's what the stack trace is for.
	</p>
	<p>
		Example stack trace:
	</p>
	<p>
		<img src="../images/breakpoint-on-xhr-stacktrace.png" alt="stacktrace for breakpointing on XHR" />
	</p>
	<p>
		Highlighted is the actual method call where the xhr request was made and quickly showing that I had <i>Any XHR</i> requests captured.
