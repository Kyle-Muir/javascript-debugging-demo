    <h1>Overview of developer tools - what's all this stuff on my screen? | <a href="..\index.html">Back</a></h1>
    <p>
        Please note, this is NOT an exhaustive list otherwise we'll be here all day. This will primarily focus on the <i>Sources</i> tab.

    <p>Items I have called out:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Sources - items you have added to this particular page. Scripts, html, css</li>
        <li>Console - an interactive console where you can run JavaScript commands (including calling any third party libraries you may have). Insanely powerful.</li>
        <li>&lt;top frame&gt; - allows you to switch between <i>frames</i> and execute code in that context. Extremely useful for Microsoft CRM where it adds tons of iFrames for shits and giggles</li>
        <li>Pause, step over, step in, step out, so forth - if you aren't familiar with any set of debugging tools these allow you to navigate around while you have breakpoints that are hit</li>
        <li>Console shortcut, settings and docking - three common things. I tend to pop my console out to a seperate window if I have more than one monitor for that glorious real estate</li>
    </ul>
