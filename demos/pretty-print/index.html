    <h1>Pretty Print | <a href="..\index.html">Back</a></h1>
    <p>
        When working with minified JavaScript you may not have the option to debug into the non-minified version. To get around this, pretty print was invented. This is now incorporated directly into the chrome developer tools. Pretty print manipulations will last for the entire session, regardless of page changes and so forth.
    </p>
    <p>
        Before pretty print:
    </p>
    <p>
        <img src="../images/pretty-print-before.png" alt="Before using pretty print"/>
    </p>
    <p>
        After pretty print:
    </p>
    <p>
        <img src="../images/pretty-print-after.png" alt="After using pretty print"/>
    </p>
    <p>
        Sure, it might not look much better - but at least gives you a better idea of what's going on and you can breakpoint and step through a lot easier in the formatted version.
