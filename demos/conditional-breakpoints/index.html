    <h1>Conditional Breakpoints | <a href="..\index.html">Back</a></h1>
    <p>
        Conditional breakpoints are useful in repetitive tasks. For example, you have a massive list of items being added to a grid and one of these isn't rendering nicely. You can breakpoint for the item that is causing you grief rather than looping through the entire list.
    </p>
    <p>
        They can also be used on complex types by simply filtering on the property you want, for example, <i>object.id === 1092</i>
